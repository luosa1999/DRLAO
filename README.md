# DRLAO:
  Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) has gained significant attention as a real-time computing paradigm extending to the network edge. It addresses the demands of low-latency, high-bandwidth applications by moving computation closer to users. However, traditional offloading methods fall short of meeting modern user requirements.
  Wireless power transmission has led to wireless energy-powered edge servers, offering flexibility and mobility by eliminating the need for wired power sources.
  In this context, we explores a wireless-powered MEC network where edge servers not only have computing capabilities but also transmit radiofrequency energy to Wireless Edge Devices (WEDs). WEDs receive and convert this energy for storage and local computation or task offloading. The paper introduces an adaptive algorithm, DRLAO (Deep Reinforcement Learning-based Adaptive Offloading), in which the algorithm's parameters are continuously adjusted automatically. 
The experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm, in comparison to the baseline, achieves near-optimal performance. Moreover, even in dynamic environments, it ensures real-time task offloading, optimal decision-making, and efficient energy resource allocation.
The code will be released as soon as the paper is accepted.
